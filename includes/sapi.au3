these are the values to use with the second speech parameter.

Value

Description

0

Default – Synchronous. Control waits until the speaking is done.

1

Asynchronous. Control returns immediately after the command has been accepted which may be BEFORE the text is actively spoken.

2

Purge Before Speak.

All other text statements are purged before it speaks.

4

Is File Name.

Instead of reading the text passed, opens the file and reads the file specified.

8

IsXML. You can send grammatical and pronunciation rules to the Speech engine (see below).

16

IsNotXML. By default, the variables are not read as XML.

32

PersistXML. Changes made in one speak command will persist to other calls to Speak.

64

SpeakPunctuation

With this flag, punctuation is actually spoken so the "." becomes the word "period"

; get_number_of_voices

; Returns the name of the voice that you specify. Once again, it is 0 based. For example, if ; I pass 0 to this function, it will return "Microsoft Mary" on my system. However, it is ;different for every user.
; Return values
; Success returns the name of the voice.
; Failure returns 0 and sets @Error to -1, this will for example be the case if you try to ; get the name of a voice that does not exist. Sometimes, there are corrupt or invalid
; voices on the system, it will return 0 and set @Error to -1 then as well.
; Obviously, those voices cannot be used even though they're in the list, if you try AutoIt ; will generate an error.
